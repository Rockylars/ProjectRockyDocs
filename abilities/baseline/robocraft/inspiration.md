Robocraft started off with a limit of 1500 CPU you could place, where this was mostly divided into guns, thrusters, radar items, armor and movement.
This changed a bit when Megaguns were added, making you able to go glass cannon by sacrificing a ton of CPU for just 2 gigantic guns, or 1 big one and a few smaller.
Another introduction of using CPU in an interesting way were the modules.
Modules allowed you to get an ability such as teleporting (blink), shield placement (dsm), invisibility (cloak), mass radar detection (windowmaker) and stunning (emp).
They were costly, averaging around 275 CPU a piece, they were greatly powerful but limited in such.
The problem was that it was really difficult to actually use them, as you'd sacrifice so much CPU you'd only have so much left for armor and guns, but it was often worth it.
Later on the limit was raised to 1750 and then 2000 CPU, allowing you to easily carry 3 modules, though most used 1 or 2 and focused more on armor/guns.

The modules played a great role in spicing up the gameplay, though it went from a slow strategy to a quicker action game due to them.
This wasn't bad per se, but it definitely played along in the downfall of the 10v10 loop.
It did honestly add flair and spice for those who needed it, such as plasma bombers built heavier in a way that they couldn't climb up on their own or invisible tesla cages.

The main problem with them was how people could now escape far quicker and regenerate or it would become an endless shield placing battle.
In the end, I'd say they added what was needed to make the game a more enjoyable experience rather than a stale game only autistic people like us would love to play for hours at a time.
