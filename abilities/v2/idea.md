We refined the ideas, specifically that the base ability everyone gets is a regen ability. This was already discussed but now has been basically locked in.
I like the abilities as partial powerups, not things you have to use while in battle, but just generally supportive powers like Blink (teleport) was in RC.

in RC, its either a getaway or invincibility, here I want them as a temporary boost in:
- health = barebones
- - An ability that regenerates a big part of your structure back up of your bot and those around you, but only for 1 HP each.
- - Its to get part of your structure back up without having the old RC auto-regen problem and without punishing medics.

- speed = overdrive

- defense = shield

- energy = restore
- - Like the energy module in RC

- stealth = invisibility

- evasion = teleport

- push = EMP
- - In RC this used to be a beacon that would come down after a big area warning.
- - In RC the problem with this was that it often missed and when it did hit, it was due to your teammates blocking you.
- - It also was never fun due to being a stunlock.

- coordination = radar
- - Marking a player for everyone even when nobody is nearby, similar to the awfully named Windowmaker module in RC.

- These will basically be tertiary weapons, they charge up when your energy bar is fully complete (so when not firing and your energy bar has filled), but will be drained when the reactor is hit and you've already lost all energy.
- Upon use, they will grant this over a specified period of time, with each having a unqiue-ish charging time.
- I will not add a firerate boosting ability for many of reasons, they unbalance things a lot and make them get unintentionally high damage output, firerate cooldown is what balanced damage.
- Cheesy long range EMP strats dont promote awareness in a good way, it should give people instead a reason to go up close and to not go up close, that is their design purpose, their power shouldn''t be used from a distance as it just keeps people at a constant range war, it should bring reward and punishment for going up close, and I mean UP CLOSE.. not RC EMP up close.

You can only have one per bot, with the benefit of doing it through a selection menu so you don't have to gut your bot out just to try a different one.
- Was also thinking of an ability that forms a tube of energy, it slows enemies and speeds up teammates in any direction, or just one direction if need be.
- Thought of an ability similar to the above, you fire out a lightning ball which slowly moves forwards and gives energy to the players it travels along, might be better than the energy ability.
- An ability was discussed, where you get multi aim at a radius of ~3 connected bots from your core. For a short while you get to hit multiple people depending on what gun aims at who. Also works for healing guns healing teammates, will be very situational but can be super helpful. Its still an ability you gotta give up frame healing for. This was something we were going to and probably still are going to add to the Shocker (electrolaser) line.
- An ability where all guns fire in volleys, this is a pretty damn good one that I will keep. It is similar in line to the v1 of weapon design, but pulled back into the design after being taken out, just differently.
