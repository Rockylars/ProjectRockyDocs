Unfortunately, this data for now got lost to time.
It might be found somewhere in the QnA channel, or by doing a lot of digging, but I consider it lost data.
We basically iterated over a bunch of ideas for fun abilities with regards to the RC baseline, such as self-destruction, charging blasts and dashes.
All the crazy ones like regen(eration) have been nerfed and balanced out further, but it was fun thinking of all of them.

These were already made with the thought that you can only equip one of 'em, and thus they were made a bit more crazy than usual as they had to balance out against a 10-20% regen ability.

Trying to read back on it, it seems we were somehow talking about stackable buffs and such.
I also see talks about a knockback ability like a big blast, kinda funny, should probably look into keeping that for the future.
We did also talk about how abilities should not interfere with someone's vision or damage, maybe even movement.

Here was an interesting list that Orter made, though I disagreed with it, it still shows the mindset back then.
I mean we were even talking about a homing shot ability and a so-called "mini megabot" ability, similar to the RC megabot seat that later got turned into the energy module.
The mini megabot idea is still on the table, but i'm unsure whether they should have to sacrifice their ability for it, it does seem fair.

- 20% (or 25%.. or even 30%) health restored (default reactor ability, they'll all be equally balanced/useful, you gain 1% HP every few seconds anyways).
- EMP field around your bot.
- EMP field placed on the floor in a much larger radius.
- Anti-gravitational field around your bot.
- Anti-gravitational field placed on the floor in a much larger radius.
- Decoy AI/ghost spawning (will use way less energy and lasts much longer).
- Temporary invisibility.
- Shield in front of you (round).
- Shield in front of you (wide rectangle).
- Shield carried around in front of the player (small).
- Damage reduction for a short period of time.
- Health given back (not much, like 15%) to a max of 5 allies around you, wont help your bot in any way however.
- Energy restored.
- Energy regen boost.
- Overdrive in movement parts, general speedboost.
- Fire a metal drillhead that can go through mountains to hit enemies on the other side, the projectile can penetrate through multiple enemies and hit multiple times, also has a sound to indicate it, but will take some health away.
- Sentries, will take about 15% of your max health away until they are destroyed, multiple can be placed, going past 100% will kill you.
- Electric storm, zaps electricity from your bot in every direction, will chain between enemies.
