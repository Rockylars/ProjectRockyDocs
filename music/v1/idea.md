### Inspiration

Music has always been a little bit difficult for a game where one day you're just building and the other day you're just fighting.
You need to have a wide choice in music, but also make the music fit the level. In my case, I've always just reduced the music to 3% and kept it at that.
You want the music to give energy, but never to be too far to where listening to it for 10 times makes you want to turn the music off.
Below I've made a good first sample of what I think gives a good impression.

For build mode, I want to focus on Chillwave and Electro:
- [Aries Beats](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCVz37WOEw1mPyIpx8xPHBmg): [Upbeat](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r2UbGqWJg6E), also available [here](https://youtu.be/LTln_sCHfQs?t=1289). A bit too energetic for what we're trying to accomplish, but it has a relaxing beat.

For test mode, I want to focus on SynthWave:
- [Hotel Pools](https://soundcloud.com/hotelpoolsmusic): [Crush](https://soundcloud.com/hotelpoolsmusic/crush), also available [here](https://www.youtube.com/watch?t=718&v=W1m7RTDlI58). The tones are a bit too high, but it is very chill.
- [Forever Electric](https://twitter.com/FElectric86): [Spearmint Skies](https://open.spotify.com/track/1u9CxADU98APVZQ4oXOUVe), also available [here](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W1m7RTDlI58&t=300s). Bit too energetic, but very cool.

For battle mode, I want to focus on DarkSynth:
- [DJ Mason](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mason_(musician)): [Exceeder](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=02NCMFt9VPo&t=41s). The upbeat nature really fits Wipeout HD but is too energetic for us, the electric guitar riff throughout the song is real good though (this one isn't even DarkSynth so of course it barely fits).
- [Acryl Madness](https://acrylmadness.bandcamp.com/): [Night Watch](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0lsBF1Mhi_k&t=1944s), original seems to be removed. It has a good windup and the latter part has some great choir filling it up, a good inspiration but nothing on its own.
- [Occam's Laser](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCWGHZyEw5gJB3wlWQYzKQtg): [The Late Repentant](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SA4upA0vNfk), also available [here](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LyS2EgLcdM8&t=2321s). Great energy, maybe a bit too much but the dark tones suppress that energy and bring it to the back of your mind, works fantastic and especially the electronic beeps.
- [Matt Majcan](https://mmajcan.bandcamp.com/): [Pharotek (remix)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Hw-HtApv91k), originally composed by Jarrid Mendelson [here](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VC470ZRDK_8). It has the futuristic vibe it needs, has energy, but not enough and a bit too much in the music department. It is overwhelming but sounds great (just not for our game).
- Tommy van Leth: [Pharotek](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P0LcCoJsdzA), a remix of the one from Tiberian Sun, the one just mentioned prior. Great as the one before it with a softer musical tone that I desire, though still a bit off from what i need. Extremely close to what would work though, just too many high notes.
- [Occam's Laser](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCWGHZyEw5gJB3wlWQYzKQtg): [Chaos](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a6iNt6ZkJLE), also available [here](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Mbjqs7AVJJk&t=201s). Great as well, maybe a bit too musically active with the heavy riff, but REALLY good still.
- [Occam's Laser](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCWGHZyEw5gJB3wlWQYzKQtg): [Insanity](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2M4H9u24Hfg). Bit too many high pitched notes in the beginning (It's my taste though) for the game, too musically active, but just a good banger, the perfect amount of energy.
- [Aim To Head](https://www.youtube.com/c/aimtoheadofficial): [John Wick](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P6COGfII5Ks). While it is Dark Techno, it just fits perfectly right, like it just feels right for a robot to robot vehicular battle inside a giant meteorite crater on Mars.
- [Aim To Head](https://www.youtube.com/c/aimtoheadofficial): [Harm](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HRZmhaqFitI). Really fitting, I'd say this is the perfect example of a generic song in this genre, in the best way.
- [Aim To Head](https://www.youtube.com/c/aimtoheadofficial): [Murdok](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I4OIhfXkxXE). Another good generic song, with a bit more style to it, extremely fitting as well.
- [Aim To Head](https://www.youtube.com/c/aimtoheadofficial): [Famine](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u7qL0hGyaSU). Another fantastic entry into the generic series, combining the strength of both the previous while relaxing on the amount of drum and riff to a great middle line.
- [Aim To Head](https://www.youtube.com/c/aimtoheadofficial): [Wegot](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wAi8cugLtKg). It's banger after banger, this one has a great slower rhythm which would perfect as a background track, but could do with a tiny bit more spice.
- [Aim To Head](https://www.youtube.com/c/aimtoheadofficial): [Hemophagy](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2utvRizIz5s). Perfect rhythm and interaction, would flawlessly fit in as a background track for cruising through an ice planet gunning down futuristic vehicles.
- [Aim To Head](https://www.youtube.com/c/aimtoheadofficial): [Ascent](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fSug2aMdxPQ). Has a great beat and punch to it, some high and low tunes, fixes what all the previous ones lacked.
- [Aim To Head](https://www.youtube.com/c/aimtoheadofficial): [Blackbird](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O6-5eyOanKc). Great expansion onto more chiptune-like notes and an exciting rhythm, an excellent fit.
- [Aim To Head](https://www.youtube.com/c/aimtoheadofficial): [Born Dead](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fvnurwuaJ38). Very heavy but a great music to have playing while roaming around the planet, shooting down planes.
- [Occam's Laser](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCWGHZyEw5gJB3wlWQYzKQtg): [Antigen](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uwKzU2Vf5RQ). Exciting but not too exciting, a gorgeous track to listen to while flying.

For race mode, I don't know yet. 

> Race mode is meant to be a lot like Sonic & All-Stars Racing Transformed, where you can change between a plane, boat and car.
> It will allow you to enter a battle with 3 different bots, where we somehow gotta encompass combat into it.
> You'll select 3 bots and switch between them while driving along the track, I honestly don't know if combat should be in it.
> The abilities for knockback and teleport will of course be in it, they'll add a great amount to it, but we need it to be where spamming thrusters isn't the only way to win.
> We might have it be more than 3, such as sleds, hovers, copters, planes, insects and just.. just every type, maybe different routes per type, simply don't know enough yet.
