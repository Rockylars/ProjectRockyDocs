### Inspiration
For build mode, I want to focus on Chillwave and Electro:
- [Aries Beats](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCVz37WOEw1mPyIpx8xPHBmg): [Upbeat](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r2UbGqWJg6E), also available [here](https://youtu.be/LTln_sCHfQs?t=1289). A bit too energetic for what we're trying to accomplish, but it has a relaxing beat.

For test mode, I want to focus on SynthWave:

- [Hotel Pools](https://soundcloud.com/hotelpoolsmusic): [Crush](https://soundcloud.com/hotelpoolsmusic/crush), also available [here](https://www.youtube.com/watch?t=718&v=W1m7RTDlI58). The tones are a bit too high, but it is very chill.
- [Forever Electric](https://twitter.com/FElectric86): [Spearmint Skies](https://open.spotify.com/track/1u9CxADU98APVZQ4oXOUVe), also available [here](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W1m7RTDlI58&t=300s). Bit too energetic, but very cool.


For battle mode, I want to focus on DarkSynth:

- [DJ Mason](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mason_(musician)): [Exceeder](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=02NCMFt9VPo&t=41s). The upbeat nature really fits Wipeout HD but is too energetic for us, the electric guitar riff throughout the song is real good though (this one isn't even DarkSynth so of course it barely fits).
- [Acryl Madness](https://acrylmadness.bandcamp.com/): [Night Watch](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0lsBF1Mhi_k&t=1944s), original seems to be removed. It has a good windup and the latter part has some great choir filling it up, a good inspiration but nothing on its own.
- [Occam's Laser](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCWGHZyEw5gJB3wlWQYzKQtg): [The Late Repentant](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SA4upA0vNfk), also available [here](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LyS2EgLcdM8&t=2321s). Great energy, maybe a bit too much but the dark tones suppress that energy and bring it to the back of your mind, works fantastic and especially the electronic beeps.
- [Matt Majcan](https://mmajcan.bandcamp.com/): [Pharotek (remix)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Hw-HtApv91k), originally composed by Jarrid Mendelson [here](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VC470ZRDK_8). It has the futuristic vibe it needs, has energy, but not enough and a bit too much in the music department. It is overwhelming but sounds great (just not for our game).
- Tommy van Leth: [Pharotek](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P0LcCoJsdzA), a remix of the one from Tiberian Sun, the one just mentioned prior. Great as the one before it with a softer musical tone that I desire, though still a bit off from what i need. Extremely close to what would work though, just too many high notes.
- [Occam's Laser](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCWGHZyEw5gJB3wlWQYzKQtg): [Chaos](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a6iNt6ZkJLE), also available [here](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Mbjqs7AVJJk&t=201s). Great as well, maybe a bit too musically active with the heavy riff, but REALLY good still.
- [Occam's Laser](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCWGHZyEw5gJB3wlWQYzKQtg): [Insanity](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2M4H9u24Hfg). Bit too many high pitched notes in the beginning (It's my taste though) for the game, too musically active, but just a good banger, the perfect amount of energy.
- [Aim To Head](https://www.youtube.com/c/aimtoheadofficial): [John Wick](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P6COGfII5Ks). While it is Dark Techno, it just fits perfectly right, like it just feels right for a robot to robot vehicular battle inside a giant meteorite crater on Mars.
