### General idea
Robocraft, the predecessor of all roboclones, usually relied on futuristic Synth/Electronic music with angelic choirs for an ethereal soundtrack.
There was some electric guitar to spice up the tempo, turning it to SynthRock, which worked really well.
This speedup was only used in BA to kick everyone awake on the ensuing chaos in the middle.

This idea is something I want to continue, having synth be the main focus for a futuristic and alien environment.
Synth is also my favorite music genre, so I may be a bit biased, but it just worked for this absurd gamestyle.
The test mode theme was actually synth rock but at a very slow tempo, similarly the build mode was slow ethereal synth.

I would like to extend this with some fitting music from the other entries, but I have barely played those.

### Inspiration
For build mode, I want to focus on Chillwave and Electro:
- [Aries Beats](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCVz37WOEw1mPyIpx8xPHBmg): [Upbeat](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r2UbGqWJg6E), also available [here](https://youtu.be/LTln_sCHfQs?t=1289) a bit too energetic for what we're trying to accomplish, but it has a relaxing beat.

For test mode, I want to focus on SynthWave:

- [Hotel Pools](https://soundcloud.com/hotelpoolsmusic): [Crush](https://soundcloud.com/hotelpoolsmusic/crush), also available [here](https://www.youtube.com/watch?t=718&v=W1m7RTDlI58), the tones are a bit too high, but it is very chill.
- [Forever Electric](https://twitter.com/FElectric86): [Spearmint Skies](https://open.spotify.com/track/1u9CxADU98APVZQ4oXOUVe), also available [here](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W1m7RTDlI58&t=300s), bit too energetic, but very cool.


For battle mode, I want to focus on DarkSynth:

- [DJ Mason](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mason_(musician)): [Exceeder](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=02NCMFt9VPo&t=41s), the upbeat nature really fits Wipeout HD but is too energetic for us, the electric guitar riff throughout the song is real good though (this one isn't even DarkSynth so of course it barely fits).
- [Acryl Madness](https://acrylmadness.bandcamp.com/): [Night Watch](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0lsBF1Mhi_k&t=1944s), original seems to be removed, it has a good windup and the latter part has some great choir filling it up, a good inspiration but nothing on its own.
- [Occam's Laser](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCWGHZyEw5gJB3wlWQYzKQtg): [The Late Repentant](https://occamslaser.bandcamp.com/track/the-late-repentant), also available [here](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LyS2EgLcdM8&t=2321s), great energy, maybe a bit too much but the dark tones suppress that energy and bring it to the back of your mind, works fantastic and especially the electronic beeps.
