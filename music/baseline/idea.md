### General idea
Robocraft, the predecessor of all roboclones, usually relied on futuristic Synth/Electronic music with angelic choirs for an ethereal soundtrack.
There was some electric guitar to spice up the tempo, turning it to SynthRock, which worked really well.
This speedup was only used in BA to kick everyone awake on the ensuing chaos in the middle.

This idea is something I want to continue, having synth be the main focus for a futuristic and alien environment.
Synth is also my favorite music genre, so I may be a bit biased, but it just worked for this absurd gamestyle.
The test mode theme was actually synth rock but at a very slow tempo, similarly the build mode was slow ethereal synth.

I would like to extend this with some fitting music from the other entries, but I have barely played those.
