# Read the [glossary](/glossary.txt) first!!
This will be written, designed and documented by me (Rocky), but there will be some images made by others every now and then.

This is the public library of our (mostly mine) thoughts regarding Project Rocky and what came before/after it.
A lot of code pieces are held private, but since my time schedule when combined with my job is a bit of a hassle, I decided to share a lot of the thoughts behind everything.
I mean the code of the project has been stagnant for like 3+ years now due to this.

Regarding that "private code" bit I just mentioned, not everything will be freely available, some parts are either not important
to know or will be kept because they are uniquely made for our project.
I do not want to end up going open source on this after all, it is not smart to allow everyone to just copy paste the project into a new roboclone.

A lot of the time you will encounter negative thoughts and revisions, this happens naturally, though it is also me that is to blame here.
Most of this is written 6 years after we first started (December 2017), so some has been lost, but I still have a lot of the old releases and even found an old version of the connection point code on one of my PCs.
I will have to write the first design of weapons from memory, so yeah, expect the old stuff to have some holes.
