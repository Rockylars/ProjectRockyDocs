For once, Robocraft is not the leader in this, their maps were often a bit... well, let's just say basic.
Also, the low poly build style of the bots never really fit with the high definition of the slowly updated maps.
Every year there would be more distance between the bots and their environment, until Vanguard's Edge brought some back.
This was all good and all, but then Birmingham Power Station immediately ruined it again.

Objects were just randomly placed because ground needed air cover, usually the map size would take care of this, but over the years the maps got smaller.
From the beginning there were already issues where tall hills both helped and troubled ground units with air in mind.

Their asymmetric, height differentiated design also slowly became more simple and mirrored, ruining the natural feel of a map.
We plan to change this, by having the bots and the world reflect the same artstyle, no matter how dated it looks.
Old RC used to look horrible around 2013/2014, but the 2015/2016 era had great map textures, which were later renewed to mixed reception.
They weren't bad but they also never matched up to the original smooth alien world design.
